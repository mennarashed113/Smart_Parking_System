# Smart Parking Lot Management System ðŸš—

## Overview
This project implements a **Smart Parking Lot Management System** to manage parking spots, vehicles, billing, and checkout operations. The system is console-based and demonstrates **OOP principles**, **SOLID design**, and a **model-service separation architecture**.

---

## Features

- **Vehicle Registration**
  - Register new vehicles with a unique plate number, type, and owner name.
  - Vehicle types supported: `CAR`, `MOTORCYCLE`, `ELECTRIC`.

- **Parking Spot Management**
  - Auto-generated spot IDs (e.g., S0, S1, S2â€¦).
  - Each spot has a type (`CAR`, `MOTORCYCLE`, `ELECTRIC`) and availability status.
  - Vehicles can only park in a spot of the matching type.

- **Parking & Checkout**
  - Park a vehicle into an available spot.
  - Checkout calculates total fees based on parking duration.
  - Parking fees per hour:
    - CAR: $5/hour
    - MOTORCYCLE: $3/hour
    - ELECTRIC: $4/hour (first hour free)

- **Reports**
  - Daily revenue report.
  - Parking ticket history.
  - Search vehicle history by plate number (optional).

- **Error Handling**
  - No available spot for the vehicle type.
  - Vehicle already parked.
  - Invalid ticket ID at checkout.
